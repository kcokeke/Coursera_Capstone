    "\n",
    "Districts in prominent cities are always seeking to attract investors to their neighbourhoods. These investors often need to know if their proposed business type is suitable or associated with the class of the district of interest.  Certain district class may have common factors that may distinguish their class to attract more of a particular type of service over other types. Hence it becomes important to study the relationship between the class categories and the common types of business venues found in a city's districts. Districts are mostly categorised into high, medium and low classes depending on relative cost of property in the districts. This study seeks to determine the extent to which the common business categories found in a district, defines the class type of the district and the accuracy of machine learning tools in making the predictions. It also aims to highlight the most common business categories associated with high, medium and low class areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto city, a prominent city with available and reliable data sources of its neighbourhoods, was used as a sample case study. Toronto city has 35 neighbourhood groups with distinct district numbers. The cost of housing index in each district was used to establish the class categories. From location dataset available, the distinct business venues and the frequency of visits was extracted for each district.\n",
